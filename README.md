# UFO Finder

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic webpage that allows the user to filter UFO sightings by several different criteria.

## Results

5 filters were implemented to allow the user to search by date, city, state, country, or UFO shape. The user is able to apply a filter(s) by typing in the criteria in the applicable field(s) and pressing ENTER, TAB, or clicking out of the field after entering the criteria. Below are screenshots of the filters in action.
