# UFO Finder

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic webpage that allows the user to filter UFO sightings by several different criteria.

## Results

5 filters were implemented to allow the user to search by date, city, state, country, or UFO shape. The user is able to apply a filter(s) by typing in the criteria in the applicable field(s) and pressing ENTER, TAB, or clicking out of the field after entering the criteria. Below, you can see the filters in action.

## Summary

Adding 4 additional filters for the dynamic table added much-needed functionality to the webpage. However, requiring the user to enter **exact, single** matches in the relevant fields is a major drawback. Below are 2 recommendations that would make the page far more user-friendly and provide additional functionality:

1. Rather than using open text fields for the filters, provide checkboxes or drop-down lists that include only cities, states, etc. present in the dataset.
2. In the date filter, provide 2 text input fields to allow the user to search for a date range, rather than a single date.
